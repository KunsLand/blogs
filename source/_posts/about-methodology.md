* __Question yourself__. Ask more questions smartly, professionally and simply. Ask yourself first.
* __Search by yourself__. Search on Intelnet, in libraries and books. Find the best existing solution to your question. Sometimes, maybe asking for a professor directly is the best solution, especially when you are in an urgent situation. If there is no one proper solution, work out one all by yourself. And sometimes, a few researches are needed.
* __Solve by yourself__. Just do it when you finally get a solution. When you meet new troubles, go to step one.

__The best way is to be prepared before the bad things occurs.__ Asking questions, searching and researching beforehand are never worthless.
__Never give up untill the last second.__
